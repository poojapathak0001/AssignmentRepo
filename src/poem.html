					Mocking Bird
				</h1>
				<article>
					It's been day's, still no word,<br>
					Are you lost? Are you hurt?<br>
					A whisper is being heard of your fall,<br>
					Rumors are finding in their way to crawl.<br>
					<br>
					I know the truth swept you ashore,<br>
					But there's always a new tide,so get aboard.<br>
					Don't let the demons of past ruin you,<br>
					I know you got the light to shoo them,<br>
					I know you do.<br>
					Don't forget that diamond was but a coal,<br>
					A bit of destiny and a lot of hard made it go bold.<br>
					<br>
					You'll get there too, just let the life polish you,<br>
					Turn your quest to 'how' and shed 'who'.<br>
					Unite with your form, and make your self heard,<br>
					Learn and then make it your own, just like the little mocking bird.<br>

					Quicksand
				</h1>
				<article>
					"I've killed you a thousand times in my mind,<br>
					It's my love that you are alive."<br>
					To see love in those lines, I sure was blind,<br>
					With the blindfold shreeded, I now prefer hate if your love is that kind.<br>
					<br>
					I let my soul sink in those deep blues,<br>
					I'm cursing myself now,<br>
					For what I thought was an ocean,<br>
					Turned out to be quicksand somehow.<br>

					Evil
				</h1>
				<article>
					Call me a sinner.<br>
					See for yourself if I care.<br>
					Once I’mma start something,<br>
					I take it to the end.<br>
					Love, hate, fight, regret;<br>
					You name it, it’s all covered.<br>
					Imperfect version of perfection,<br>
					Coz perfect is too overrated.<br>
					I let them turn tables thinking it’s their game,<br>
					Them hyenas, hungry for the two-second fame.<br>
					Coz it hurts more when they lose thinking they are winning,<br>
					Nothing is evil with the devils trying to mess with the devil queen.<br>

					Tar
				</h1>
				<article>
					I peeled off my skin,<br>
					I don’t want your trace on me.<br>
					I shaved my head, not a single strand left,<br>
					I couldn’t let them neonate touch my face.<br>
					I cut through my chest,<br>
					Grabbed that heart out,<br>
					Shot it at point blank,<br>
					It bleed white, don’t you wonder why!<br>
					Coz that’s what poison do to you,<br>
					exchange its colour with your soul,<br>
					Turns all the blood into tar.<br>

					Fake-true Love
				</h1>
				<article>
					Like a song I played you,<br>
					A song with rythm so divine!<br>
					A song I thought I fell in love with,<br>
					Until I listened to the lyrics,<br>
					It was only your rythm that I liked.<br>
					<br>
					ike a river I flow along you,<br>
					A river so serene!<br>
					A river I would have let myself drown in,<br>
					Until I started sinking in the quicksand,<br>
					It was only your tranquil outlier that I liked.<br>
					<br>
					Like a pen I wrote with you,<br>
					With ink so dark as if forever it will stay!<br>
					A pen I wrote my life with,<br>
					Until I turned back the pages and saw,<br>
					My life turned into nothingness,<br>
					It was only your transient yet beautiful ink that I liked.<br>
					<br>
					Like a memory I cherished you,<br>
					A memory I want to freeze in time!<br>
					A memory with happiness larger than this universe,<br>
					Until I realised it was but my conscience,<br>
					It was only my imagination that I mistook for real-time.<br>

					Season of Woman
				</h1>
				<article>
					Innocent & naive<br>
					like a budding flower,<br>
					She's new to this world <br>
					as soothing as a blissful shower;<br>
					She has a long way to go<br>
					& all waiting to see how she grows.<br>
					<br>
					Wow! She has blossomed,<br>
					Center of attention, she's the new one.<br>
					Full of passion & hot emotions <br>
					She's the Goddess of Love Potions.<br>
					Lookout for how she dignifies Beauty,<br>
					Do watch her glorify bold.<br>
					<br>
					Now she's a native to this land<br>
					So calm, serene, mature and tall she stands.<br>
					With the petals she shed, she's all fruitful & giving;<br>
					She reconciles the blessing, she enjoys the peaceful living.<br>
					<br>
					The fruit is shed, she's all alone,<br>
					wrinkles is all that's left, the youhful freckles are gone.<br>
					Agony & resentment is enclosing her;<br>
					But in this bitter-sweet cold, there's tranquility; she's sure.<br>
					Now don't mistake her inactivity for her fall,<br>
					For she's looking past it, sowing seed to reborn.<br>

					Bloodflower
				</h1>
				<article>
					I hate this place,<br>
					And yet I'm here:<br>
					Just to see your face.<br>
					You were laughing just now with your new love interest,<br>
					And now it have already taken pace.<br>
					<br>
					Just to see you suffer,<br>
					As much as you made me do,<br>
					I'll stick around in your downfall.<br>
					Pretend,<br>
					as if I'll catch you,<br>
					And right before the evil can touch my arms,<br>
					I'll let the concrete hit you.<br>

					It's not karma,<br>
					It's just me: the masochist that you made me be.<br>
					I was right, you were a sakura,<br>
					A bloodflower,<br>
					Only when I touched, the venom spread, <br>
					I saw the demon soul mock my chained heart.<br>

					Slayer
				</h1>
				<article>
					Little summer dress,<br>
					 Winter in her heart,<br>
					 Autumn in the eyes,<br>
					 There she goes slaying hearts,<br>
					 My black widow,<br>
					 Damn she’s fine.<br>
					 Sarcasm queen.<br>
					 She ain’t those stereotypes,<br>
					 Working the money tides,<br>
					 Perfect balance: body and mind,<br>
					 Just as hard to get as hard to find.<br>
					<br>
					No matter how hard I try she walks by,<br>
					 So I stop, rewind.<br>
					 Pause and play,<br>
					 And again let her slay.<br>
					 She got me like,<br>
					 Stop , rewind, pause & play.<br>
					<br>
					She don’t look eye to eye,<br>
					 Them other girls,<br>
					 Copying her style,<br>
					 Misery.<br>
					 She’s so fly,<br>
					 Got me wishing on a wishing well,<br>
					 To let our stars collide.<br>
					 Got a billion thoughts,<br>
					 I wanna say to you,<br>
					 But words fail to define,<br>
					 Girl, I’m spell-bound,<br>
					 Just by the thought of us,<br>
					 Let commit this perfect crime.<br>

					No matter how far I stay, I’m her prey.<br>
					 So I stop, rewind.<br>
					 Pause and play,<br>
					 And again let her slay.<br>
					 She got me like,<br>
					 Stop , rewind, pause & play.<br>
